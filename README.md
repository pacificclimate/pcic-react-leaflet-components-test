# pcic-react-leaflet-components-test

This is a React app to test end-to-end usage of components exported by
package [pcic-react-leaflet-components](https://github.com/pacificclimate/pcic-react-leaflet-components).

Its behaviour should be exactly the same as that of the demo portion
of pcic-react-leaflet-components. 

As of this writing, it is.

Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
